Start Date: February 2025

End Date: ongoing

Location: The Learning Farm (TLF), Kawungluwuk Village, Sukaresmi, Cianjur Regency, West Java, Indonesia

Description:

To confirm the feasability of a microcontroller-based automated irrigation system with ESP32s in Javanese highland farming conditions.
Various ESP32 prototypes and an automated irrigation system were implemented in TLF, collecting data on water usage, electricity usage, crop growth, crop health, etc.
This repository possesses the code required to operate these systems.
